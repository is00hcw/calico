Juju Install
============

If you're in a position to use Ubuntu's `Juju Charms`_ deployment tool, you can
quickly get a Calico-based OpenStack deployment up and running. All you need
to do is download one of our bundles, and then deploy it to your Juju
environment using `any of the standard methods`_. This will get you a simple
OpenStack deployment with two compute nodes, which you can then easily scale
out by adding more instances of the ``nova-compute`` charm.

Bundles
-------

Icehouse: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/master/docs/source/_static/juju/icehouse.yaml
Juno: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/master/docs/source/_static/juju/juno.yaml
Kilo: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/master/docs/source/_static/juju/kilo.yaml

The default admin password for the deployment is "openstack" - you may wish to
update this in the bundle (search for the keystone "admin-password" option).

For more detailed information, please see `this blog post`_ on the Calico blog.
